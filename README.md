# How to play?
- Visit the website [Here!](https://harellt.github.io/Pandon2048)
- If it shows you the pandas value but you don't know how to close it, click the "Open" Button on the bottom.
- Sometimes the Retry button doesn't show up so just restart your website.
- Mobile is not supported (I think).
